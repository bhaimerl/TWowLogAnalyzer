This tool analyzes your WowCombatLog.txt and extracts some useful informations
(Example: http://klarasprudel.atwebpages.com/schmetterlingsbrigade/3_14_2025_Naxxramas_v033_schmetterlingsbrigade.html)

You really need to have SuperwowcombatLogger: https://github.com/pepopo978/SuperWowCombatLogger?tab=readme-ov-file
and also: https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW
Otherwise a lot of useful informations (like sunder armor) will be missing in your log

At the moment you better use a clean wowcombatlog, so only with the raid you wanted to analyze,
if you have a very huge combatlog with a lot of raid over several days, the result would be broken i guess.
I start afresh log with every raid.


If you have Java installed (at least java 17) u can run it by doubleclick (if java is connected to open a jar)
or you hit a cmd shell and enter "java -jar TwowLogAnalyzer.jar"

After this a GUI opens:

Here you select ur combatlog and hit "Start"

Depending of your CPU and the Raid this can take a while ...few seconds up to 2/3 minutes,
but the GUI is telling u what at the moment is calulated....

If everything is done, it generates a html page in ur user space and opens ur system browser
with that page:
